I drank mushroom tea.  

Does your country have this mushroom?  
I don't eat or consume mushrooms so much, because they can poisonous, so there is a risk.  

I am not trying to use food, I am try to adapt my behaviour. I take cold showers, exercise regularly, 

I woke up, I didn't breathing exercises, and took a cold shower.  

Wim Hof Method breathing exercise.  

WHM application for a phone.  

This exercise consists of 30 deep breaths, you need to breath very deeply, filling your stomach, lungs, and even head with air.  
After 30 breaths you stop breathing. You try to slow down your hard, relaxed, stay withouth breathing new air as long as you can. You need to use up all the oxygen in your body.  
After you can't persist anymore, you should take one very deep breath, and hold it for 15 seconds. After 15 seconds exhale.   
Repeat everything 4 times.  

Cold showers reduce inflmations in your body, help burn fat, create clarity of mind, relaxes muslces, improves immunity, excercises blood vessels. It's a great way to deal with stress. 
Exposing to cold water is a kind of stress, but using breathing you start to control it.
