# The World of Snacks
## Discussion
How do you prepare for the class?  
I see the PPT. I pay attention to the new words, I checked the dictionary. I need to get familiar with the topic by reading it again and again.  

Why did you choose this topic?  
Snacks are very common food.  

I like nuts and fruits.  

I am really against anything plant based.  

Based on the research I have made, I think eating plants is not good for us.  

Plants contain only a little usable nutrients, and they contain a lot of toxins. 

Based on our stomach, on our intestine, we should eat primarily meat(98%).  

I think vitamin B cannot be obtained from plant-based food.  

In my country, there was a couple, with a child, a girl. They were vegeterians, so they forced their young daughter to be a vegeterian too. This girl has died from undernurishment. Parents are being sentenced for murder.  

I have a balanced died of meat and vegetables.  

Have you experienced emotional eating?  
Yes, I have.  

Why is that the way you choose to deal with emotions?  
I want to enjoy eating delicious food.  
It's an easy but a wrong way. Do you realized that?   

What can you do instead emotional eating?  
I would go to the gym.  

Do you feel tired after eating food?  
Yes, I do.  

Our body needs energy to process the food, so if you eat too much or things that are not good, your body will lose the energy.  

I was fasting for 72 hours. I didn't eat anything in three days. I felt great, after 24 hours, your body goes in the state of ketosis, which is a natural state in which your body uses your body fat for energy. Autofagy get's promoted, an active in high degree after 12 hours. Autophagy is a process in which old cells in our body get recycled.    

I recommend that you read and educate yourself about it, then you can decide if you want it or not.
