I go there with my sister in law.  

What do you think about the adult students?  
A lot of adults really want to learn something new, especially older adults.  

Why?  
When they retire, they have a enough time.  

Are retirees apply for universities in China?  
No, they don't.  

Elders go to universities for elders.  

I really don't see the point in that. If you want to learn to play piano, you don't need to go to university, just find a private coach.  

There are universities for elders but not enough universtities for young people?  
There are a lot of universities in my city.  

I hear all the time that not every child can go to high school, let alone university.  

Some of them just go directly to vocational school and learn to do a particular job. Because of their middle school exam scores.  

Is it is easy to be a student?  
They have too much responsibility.  

Does any adult studies in China?  
I have this experience. Almost 10 years ago I joined Wuhan university to learn journalism. I graduated with Master's degree.    

What were the challenges of studying at that time?  
I was very busy. I needed to balance work and study.  

Did you have any other responsibilities?  
No, I didn't.   

You need an exact goal.  

Aren't all universities good?  
A good university is an university with good teachers.
