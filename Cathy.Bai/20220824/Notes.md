How are you doing today?  
I feel so good, because the weather is weather is comfortable.  

The temperature has finally changed. It has dropped for about 10 degrees.   

I had to use air conditioner every day.

I want to invite my close friend to come to my apartment. I bought delicious fish which I want to cook for my close friend.

I don't want to start my own business.  
If I have a chance I will start a flower shop.  
I really like to arrange flowers. My friends always say I am good at arranging flowers.  

When I retire I might start a flower studio, not just for money but for satisfaction.  

Arranging flowers is something I like.  

Do you have any flowers at home?  
I always buy some flower for my home, during the whole year.    

What is your favorite flower?  
I like all white flowers.  

It's not good to bring white flower, because white flowers are brought to the graveyard in China, it's for the dead.  

White is pure and clean so couples like to use white for their weddings.  

Isn't that western tradition?  
Isn't that the influence of the west on China?  

Red color is the symbol of happiness and good luck.  

Using white color in apartment is suitable.  
The main color is light blue. It really matches white color.   

White color is commonly used in interior designs, it gives a lot of light, makes the room bright, even seem more spacious.  

I live on third floor.  
My decoration uses white color.  
From first to fifth floor, they used bright color.  

When you talk about the order in which something is arranged(floors), make sure you use ordinal numbers(first, second, third, etc.).  

Women like to wear black because it makes them look thinner, while white makes them look bigger.  

My city is near Russia. My city's lifestyles was influenced by Russia. I ate bread as a child so I came to like it very much.   

How about bakeries in China, are they possible to be successful?  
Most of bakeries are small.  

For bread to be made fresh for the breakfast, bakers start working very early at like 1 am every day.  

My friend opened a really successful bakery. It has a lot of branches.  

A lot of young people really like eating bread.  

It seems that Chinese want to adopt western lifestyle completely.  

Bread really matches coffee.  

People never eat bread and drink coffee at the same time. These two foods don't seem complementary.  

Why do some business fail?  
A lot of entrepreneurs don't have a lot of experience. They don't prepare really well.  

They borrow too much money, they depend on the dept.  

They didn't prepare well.  

RMB - this name is used in China.  
CNY(Chinese Yuan) - this is the international name.
