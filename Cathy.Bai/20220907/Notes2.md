# Do You Hate Sports?
## Discussion
How do you feel about sports?  
Sport has rules, it's a competitive game. While an exercise is not competitive, there aren't any rules, exercises are done for health benefits or in order to improve the figure(body shape).   

If you do sports well, you don't need a coach, you already do it well.  

If you already have knowledge about something, you don't need to learn it again, right?

In western countries it's rude to comment on person's body shape.  
How about in China?
