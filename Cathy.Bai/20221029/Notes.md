# Working Out At Home
## Discussion
I drank some alcohol with my brother.  
Alcohol made me relaxed.  
That's why when having a business dinner, or a meeting, people drink a little bit. Because if they are relaxed, they can communicate and negotiate better.  

Yesterday I went to see a dermatologist, and I hear that one lady said that Wuhan is being locked-down again.
