# Property Investment
## Discussion	
What do you think about this kind of investing in China?  
It's a very good way to invest.  

I heard that China has a housing bubble.  

If a market is in a bubble, it means that prices are unrealisticly high.  

It's true. In the past this kind of investing was good.   
I got profit from my property.  

The situation in China is not good.  

In the future, at some point, this bubble will burst. And people will be faced with horrible consequences. The problem is that people take loans to buy these apartments.  

When their values sharply drop, which will happennd, after the bubble bursts, people will be left in very bad situation.  

I heard that people pay more than half of their monthly income for these loans, for the period of twenty or thirty years.   

Like stocks in companies like Tesla.  
You can't beat the market.  

You have to find someting that sells cheaply.  
People want to live very luxurious life. This kind of thinking directs my behaviour.   
Real estate is very illiquid.  

There is a lot of risk.  
There are a lot of risks(different kinds).  

Have you invested in something else?  

You told me you invested in a restaurant?  
I don't operate the restaurant anymore.  

How would you spend $5 million?
I would by a small aparment and return my loan.   

I would save some money.  

Do you follow fluctuation of stock markets around the word?  
No, I don't.  

I think it's really unsafe.  

I will buy some financial products and insurance products.  

These products can't beat the inflation.  

Buying gold and silver is one of the best ways to protect yourself from inflation.  
Gold has never, in the history of the world, lost it's value.
