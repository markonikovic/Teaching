## Grammar
### Problem With Two Verbs
You can never have two main verbs in a sentence, you can have a modal or auxiliary(helping) verb with the main verb but not two main verbs.  

People enjoy(verb) play(verb) with them.  

To fix this we use gerund or infinitive form of the second verb, these forms act as nouns.  

gerund(verb + ing)  
People enjoy playing with them.  

infinitive(to + verb)  
People enjoy to play with them.  

I like watch TV(wrong)  
I like watching TV.  
I like to watch TV.
