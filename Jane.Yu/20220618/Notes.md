## Discussion
How are you doing today?  
It was a tiring day.  

Why was Saturday so busy?  
I was on exhibition on Shenzhen.  

What was being exhibited?  
It was a gift exhibition.  

How were these exhibits special?  
It's from an e-commerce platform Alibaba.  

This was a product promotion.  

Why did you go on this exhibition?  
I wanted to get more news about e-commerce. I want to get an inspiration.   

I went their to get as much of information as I can.  

Did you get the information?  
Yes, I did.  

I have seen this movie for a long time.  

The doctor who diagnosed autism wasn't very knowledgeable.  

Why didn't his parents investigate that?  
I have no idea with them.  

What are the biggest challenges when looking for love?  

Do you cook?  
No, I don't.  

I order food very often.  

What kind of food do you eat?  

You don't follow any particular diet. After I took personal training courses, my person trainer told me that I don't need to follow a certain diet.  

The research shows that being lean(having very low body fat) increases longevity(year that a person is alive).
