It's a 12 hour drive by motorbike.  

Yesterday I watched a video on YouTube, one person, motorbike ryder from Serbia, Kawazoki was his nick name. He liked to ride Kawaski motorbikes, his nickname was Zoki. He took a trip from Serbia to Japan, on motorbike. It's a trip of about 10 000 km.   

He told a story in which he was 22 years old, and he had $70 in his pocket, and it took him from Serbia to Hawaii.  

He doesn't care about speed, he cares about distance. He never rode fast, he said that he was afraid of motorbike. If people are not afraid they will not last very long.  

I personally think we shouldn't care about what other people think.  
That is their job, it's not our job.  

You don't want to live other people's lives, because then who will live yours.
