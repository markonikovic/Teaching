## Disussion
Hello, can you hear me?  

What is so noisy

Can you find somewhere more pieceful?  
It needs to be booked in advance.  

Why did you book it at the same time when you have a class?  
Booking system changed.  

I needed to be booked in advance.  
Now classes need to be booked  

I need to book the class at the same time at nine o'clock a week in advance.  

If you have classes at the same time every week, how do you forget?  
I have a bad memory.  

Where are you taking this class?  
I am taking a class in a hospital.  

Next time, just cancel it. It's so hard for me to work in noisy environments.  

What are your plans for the rest of the day?  
I don't have any plans, I just have to finish the body examination.  

You still haven't finished it.    

Why?  
There are many programs that I need to take for my body.   

I had similar experience yesterday, I am taking my second major and I am applying A1 license(motorbike license) I had to do a medical test.  
What is your relationship with your mother?  
We have a very close relatinoship, but she is definitely a domineering mother.  

She wants me to follow her directions. She has high requirements.   

She has high standards. Does she abide to those standards, requirements?  
Most of time she abides to these standards.  

What did you learn from your mother?  
I like to procrastinate in everything. I know I shouldn't procrastinate. She is very nice person. She is willing to sacrifice herself for ther kids.      

If someone overexagerates discipline and overemphasiezes behavior, it's probably because they want to create a great image. In reality people are not perfect.  

Being polite helps people get a chance, to become friends, partners of employees.  

If you send your child to attend 10 different extracurricalar classes. I would say that you are not being realistic and probably concerned more about the image.  

If you compare yourself with people Elon Musk, no matter what you do you would seem incompetent next to him.
