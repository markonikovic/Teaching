I am fine.  

I ride an electric bike.  

I don't like electric bikes.    
In Serbia people don't need any kind of license to ride a electric motorbike. These bikes can be relatively fast, up to 30 or 40 km per hour. At the same time these people don't know the basic rules of traffic. I think they are very dangerous.
