Why do some people risk their lives and health for their profession or job?  
People are careless, and they don't abide to the rules.  

People want a challenge, they want to test their skills. Sometimes they make a little mistakes in their work.   

Are these jobs paid well?  
Most of these jobs are not paid well.  

Do you have any other ideas?  
I hope that robots can be used to do these jobs, instead of people. 

After all, human life is the most precious thing.  
I hope that autonomous(driverless) cars can be used. I hope this technology can be used for trucking first.
