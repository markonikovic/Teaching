I have two kids, my daugher is 8 and my son is 7 years old.  

You were so busy with them?

Do you like to make presentations?  
Yes, I do.  

Why?  
It can make people better understand your job.  

Is giving a presentation stressful?  
Yes, it is.  

When you prepare the presentation and being to make it, you must be stressed. When you begin to present the topic, you are not sure if other people can understand what you mean or not.  
In the end you can see if they agree with your presentation or not.  

I din't assume making a presentation is difficult, I thought delivering presentation is more stressful.
