## Discussion
What was the matter?  
Your PC was locked down.  

Why?  

What happened?  
My PC locked down, so I logged in the class from my smart phone.  

It's Sunday, so how did you spend it?  
I got up at noon, and then I worked for a while.   
I didn't do anything special today.  

No special things.(grammitically incorrect - incomplete sentence - it's missing a verb)  

It's not in nature in western companies to work on Sunday.  
Cisco is an American company, a guess your colleagues from the USA, or other countries and companies are not working today.  

In China people don't have days off?  
When do you have days off?  
You just told me that people work during weekends, so they are not days off.  

Why was the system cut down?  
Why do they do that?  
It's because they don't want their employees to burn out, to work overtime.  

You speak like Chinese are not other people, you speak like you have different bodies, and needs.  

I am not against hard work. I am just against working overtime.  

As you spend more hours, you efficiency decreases.
