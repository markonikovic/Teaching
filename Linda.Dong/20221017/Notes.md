If someone doesn't like you, that doesn't mean that you will have conflict.  

There are many people I don't like, so they are not my friends, I choose people who I like.  

You should pretend to be something you are not so everyone likes you.  

I know some people, and they so vague, they never express their opinion, they just agree with everyone, and seems that everyone likes them, but I see that they don't have real friends.  

If everyone would be 100% with himself or herself, everyone would like his or her job.  

This psychology is a psychology of courage.

We want the best, not mediocre.  

It's better to have a mediocre company with very good menagement, than an excellent comapany with a horrible management.
