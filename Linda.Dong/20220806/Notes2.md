# Crisis Management
## Discussion
The platform doesn't have many teachers.  

Many students complain about that.  

It's difficult to book any classes.  

What is a crisis?  
It's something unpredictable and bad.  

We can use crisis as learning experience.  

If crises occurs frequently, that's a sign, that something is seriously wrong.  

Becase of chip shortages and logistic issues, our product needed more time.  

I had to apologize to customers.  

How well did you manage to overcome this crisis?  
It's not easy. Normally I need to learn the background of each customer. I need to know how our product or solution impacts their business, I needed to make two or three proposals to customers.  

I guess that increased your workload immensely.  

Everyone would have prefered if the situation didn't change.  

Does chip shortage still exists?  
Yes, it's still a problem.  

There aren't enough vehicles or drivers. A lot of ports were impacted by Covid-19.  
Delivery companies are also affected.  

This situation, I think exists only in China.  
In the USA and Europe, we are not concerned with Covid-19 anymore.  

I always shop online and delivery is always on time. Products that are shipped from other countries normally takes two or three months, but because of Covid-19 it increased seriously.  

Do you work well under pressure?  
I would rank 70 out of 100.  

It seems to me that you don't preform the best under pressure.  

I can reflect to my university years. I was a stable learned, I would wake up at 6 o'clock, cook a cup of coffee, start studying for three hours, went to university attend the classes, etc.  

My roommate was completely different. He didn't study at all, not until 5 days before an exam, during that time he almost didn't sleep at all. But he was a good student.  

Pressure has positive influence on him.  

He doesn't have discipline.  

If he is not under pressure, he doesn't study anything, however I can study all the time.  
I am not a disciplined person.  

People talk about motivation too much. You might feel motivated to exercise today, but of course there will be days when you are not motivated e.g. you can have a bad day at work  

But if you are disciplined you will exercise even though you don't feel like it.  

I often exercise even though, at that moment I don't feel like it, but I have never regretted it. It always made me feel good about yourself.  

I am reaseraching natural and traditional medicine.  

I want to create my own system for health, I don't want to rely on westen medicine.  
When I go to see a doctor, I always get to buy pills or some kind of medication.  

They don't check my body well, there is not holistic approach.  

I had very big and painful pimples on skin of my shoulders. 

Plants contain a lot of toxins.  

Cabbage is a leaf, it was not meant to be eaten, and cabbage creates toxins to prevent animal from eating eat.  

**When make a mistake, don't just ignore, go back and correct yourself.**
