How are you doing today?  
I just came back from my husband's home town. It's very far away, about 2000 km. We just came back from there.  

Why did you go there?  
We went there to see my husband's mother.  

How is she?  
She is ill and not very good. We went there to see her.   

What is wrong with her?  
She is already 90 years old. It's easy for old people to get ill.  

Does she have any chronical illnesses?  
She has been in bed for more than three years, can't speak, and her mind is not very clear.  

I think she had a stroke.  

My grandmother had a stroke, her entire left side of the body was paralized. She could speak, and use her right side, but the left side was out of her control.  

My grandmother had a stroke because of hypertension, she didn't take the midicine, that was prescribed by her doctor.  

Old people don't like to take medication and they don't want to have regular medical check ups. 

Maybe they are afraid that something bad will be discovered.  

He refused to go to hospital to do a check up. He is afraid that some bad disease will be discovered.  

He is old, he doesn't know how much time he has left, he doesn't want to spend his last days in hospital or something.  

He just wants to enjoy the rest of his life.  

Younger people should definitely go to see doctors.  

My grandmother was only 50 when she has a stroke.  

My mother had something on her breast for many years. My sister, and I insisted that she goes to see a doctor. But she refused every time. When it became really bad, she finally went, and it was cancer.   
It was actually very late stage, but because of chemo therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, she is OK now.  

It would be much easier to fix that if she went on time.  
They had to cut her entire right breast.  

All the therapies she had were free.  

We pay a lot for our health insurance, people who work.  

I think that every company pays in Serbia pays about 28% of bruto salary for every worker.  

I think everyone deserves help, even if the person is without money.  

Entrepreneurs make the most money.  

If you are good at anything, you can make pretty good money.  

IT guys make a lot of money.  

Serbia is not a member of European union.  

I think Chinese companies are very interested in Serbia.  

I lot of roads and infrastructure are built by Chinese companies. 
When there was the first wave of Covid19 we got a very good deal with China, we bought Chinese vaccines cheaply.  

We are very similar antropologically.  

Our population is about 7 million people.  

They removed Russian Rubbles from SWIFT system.  
Putin just decided that they cannot buy Russian without Russian Rubble.  

Even if China starts a war, they cannot do much, China is too important for global economy.  

Europe cannot survive without Russian, grains, oil and gas.  

Sunflower oil is heavily used in Europe for cooking. Russia and Ukraine are the biggest producers of sunflower in the world.  

Countries like Germany were completely out of sunflower oil. The price has increase 10 times.   

Germany imports almost all it's electricity.  
Sunflower oil is much cheaper that soya oil or peanut oil.  

All European countries are heavily influenced and controled by the USA.  

There is very high inflation, everything is becoming more expensive every month. The wood, which is used as a source of heating energy, has increase 120% since last year. Many people are afraid that Russia is going to cut the gas.   

Electricity will be 6% more expensive from next year.  

The price of meat has increased at least 20%.  

Some of these prices are a little bit exaggerated.  
The producers are not sure about the real value anymore, so they charge more than it's normal, but we have free market, so after a while, the price will change.  

We buy a pig. We hire a butcher, who kills and prepares the meat, and we put meat in our fridge, we save about 40%.  

Pork and chicken are the most popular kinds of meat. Beef is expensive so people eat it less.  

We import a lot of beef from Australia and America.
