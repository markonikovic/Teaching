# The Work Week
## Discussion
I made red sugar cake for my son.    

We had a dinner, it was already half past seven. I took my son out for a walk. We came back at half past eight. I gave my son a quick shower and I took a quick shower. I am having this class right now.   

How are you going to spend your Sunday?  
We are going to a water park.  

What activities can you do there?  
I don't know.  
There are some activities that you can enjoy in a water park. There is a swimming pool.  

There is a water slide.  
There are a lot of slides.  

You have never been to a water park before?  
It was seven or six years ago. I went to a water park with my classmate.  

Can you see any animals there?  
People wear a swim suits and play. It's opened from June 10th to July 10th.   

Why is it open for such a short time?  
The rest of the summer is not suitable for swimming and bathing?  
I applied for a gym membership today.  

I also both classes for my to learn swimming.  

In my country swimming pools start working on 20th June and they work untile late August.  

How long is the work week for you?  
I work for five days a week.   

Is that too much or too little?  
I think it's perfect.  

Do most people in China have two days off?  
No, they don't.  

Some workers who are not white-collar work for six days a week.  

I think white-collar workers also work six days a week quite frequently.  
There is Chinese expression 9-9-6.  

Even though you are paid, it's a huge pressure.  

You don't know anyone who works like this?  
One of my colleagues, she worked today. She couldn't finish her task.  
She needs to catch up.  

Why has this happended? Is it because she is inefficient? Or her workload is too heavy?  
It's a complex task.  

She might be stuck on a particular problem for a long time.    

She worked for several days on this job but she did wrong way.  

How can you do your job in a wrong way?  
If you want to achieve something new, you need to think about it. There could be several methods you can choose from.  

As an experienced worker, you should kinda know, what methods to use.  

As you get more experience coding, you can have better judgment of what will work and what won't.  

When I solve a difficult issue I feel proud.  

Do you have any questions?(Simple present)  
No, I don't.
