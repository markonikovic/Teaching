## Grammar
### Tenses
In English, we are being very precise(exact) with the time. It's really important to express time correctly in each sentence. We use verb tenses to express the time.

I work as an English teacher.(true at the moment)  

### The Two Verbs Problem
In English language you can only have one main verb, in one sentence.  

I like eat food.(wrong - there are two main verb)  

You need to change the second verb into a noun. You can do this in two ways:

#### Two ways to create a noun out of verb:
1. Infinitive form(to + verb)
I like to eat food.  

1. Gerund form(verb + ing)
I like eating food.   

* Don't use both.  
We need to loading the goods.(wrong)  
We need to load the goods.(correct)
