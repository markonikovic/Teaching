When are you going to have your lunch?  
I will have a lunch after this class.  

From 11 am to 5:30 pm, there are 6 hours and 30 minutes.  

I seldom eat snacks between meals.

Maybe tea helps as well, between meals.  

I eat once a day. I am a carnivore. I have been a carnivore for about three months.      

I used to have red rashes on my skin, pimples, things like that, and I don't have them anymore. I believe it's becase of plant based food.  

I usually eat about 500 grams of meat(pork, chicken, beef, fish...), three egs, 10 quail eggs, and one whey protein isolate shake.  

Do you have any health concerns?  
I am worried about my weight.  
Since I left the army my weight has increased by 10 kg.  

I have managed to stabilize my weight, I am not gaining any more.  

Do you trust food and pharmacutical industry?  
Why is health industry allowed to produce such unhealthy foods?
