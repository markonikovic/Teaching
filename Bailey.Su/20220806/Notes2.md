# Building Muscle Quickly
## Discussion
Have you tried to build your muslce?  
Yes, but it was long time ago.  

Were you successful?  
No, I wasn't.  

Why?  
It's difficult to persist.  

Did you go to the gym?  
Yes, I did.  

Do you remeber your gym workout?  
I lifted weights, ran, and swum.  

How often did you go to the gym?  
I went to gym three times a week.  

Besides exercising, do we need anything else to build muscle?  
We need to eat enough calories.  

We also need nutrients.  

Protein is especially important for building muscle.  

What food is rich in protein?  
Meat(beef, chicken white meat, tuna fish, salmon, etc.), eggs, dairy(cheese, cream) etc.  

What was your diet like when you were building muscles?  
I ate a lot of chicken and schrimps.  

Do you know how much protein we should take to build muscle?  
There is a measure: 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. (If you weigh 80kg, then you need to take 160 grams a day)

If you really want to build big muscle you need to eat a lot of meat.  
There is no way around it.  

People also like to supplements.  

Because it's so hard to eat enough protein, many people, use whey protein powder.

Have you ever tried to use it?  
No, I haven't.  

It's hard to eat enough protein, you need to a lot of meat(0,5 kg of beef, and 10 eggs)

I do 3x system training, jump rope, boxing, TRX ropes, ashanga yoga, iron neck, kettle bells, Wim Hof Method...  

Where do you exercise?  
I exercise at home.  

When do you exercise?  
After this class I will have two hours break, so I will use this time to jump rope, to box, X3 and take a cold shower.  

After our class I used kettlebell.

That is the advantage of working from home.  

My workout is Push&Pull workout.  

If you are disciplined you can do a lot from home. Although I teach many classes every day, I have time to exercise and study things that I am interested in.  

Exercises that I do are very simple.  
I do deadlifts, bench presses, lat pull downs, etc.  

For yoga I have bought a special book. Yoga is the most complicated system of exercises that I use.  

I have bought a book about Thai boxing and I have had some classes when I was in Thailand.  

That's one way of learning.  

In Ashtanga yoga, the grand master said very important thing: "99% practice, 1% theory".  

I try to do the workouts and at the same time learn about them and improve them. It's a process.  

Coding is like that too.  

Making mistakes is part of learning.  

I think there has been a long conflict between Israel and Palestine.  

No I don't teach German.  

Why do you ask?  
I want to learn German.
