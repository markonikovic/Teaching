# Being A Project Manager
## Discussion
I was cooking and I was tired, so I missed yesterday's class.  

How are you doing today?  
Everything is good.  

What did you do?  
I worked.  
I worked from home.  

Why?  
Because my daughter was transfered to another kindergarten. The staff in this kindergarten is on vacation until next week.   

Try to copy and paste the following link in the browser.  

China has a policy about the Internet, a lot of websites are unavailable in China.  
I will make the link for you in the evaluation, I will include the link to the Notes.pdf in the evaluation of this class.  

How is the weather today in China?  
The weather today is sunny.  

What is the temperature?  
It's 25 degrees Celsius. Tomorrow it will be 37 degrees Celsius.  
It's still summer, so you can expect hot weather.  

This summer is hotter than the previous summer. The temperature is increasing globally.   

Why is the temperature increasing globaly?  
There is pollution. It is also a natural process.  

We produce CO2(carbondioxide) when we breathe.  

There are many people, and a lot of animals.  

We need more trees, forests, and plants in general.  

I am not yet married.  

Those are my nieces, they playing in the swimming pool in my yard.  
My sister from Germany, is visiting me, so her children are here too.  

I hope to get married in next two years.  
Yes, I do.  
But at least one, but my dream is to have three children.  

How many do you want?  
I don't want more children.  

Raising children is too expensive in China.  

In Serbia, it's not that expensive.  
In Serbia, education is free, you just need to buy books and notebooks for your child.  
You don't need to buy any private lessons, or anything like that.  

Our government wants to support good students, so for them it's free. If you are not so good, to get government support, it's still very afforable.  e.g. One year at law university in Novi Sad costs around 800 EUR(5500RMB - for four years it would be 22000 RMB) you have a canteen in university and one lunch costs 3 RMB.  

Other expenses on what lifestyle student has.  

The cost of renting an apartment is too high.  

A lot of parents, try to buy an apartment when their children go to university. So even if you have 3 children they can all use to study in the capital city, or the city where university is located.   

It's not so bad.  
Apartments in Serbia are much cheaper than in China.  

You can buy a good apartment in Novi Sad for 100 000EUR(680 000RMB)
My apartment is 3 000 000 RMB more expensive.  

So you could buy five apartments in Novi Sad for this money.  

We don't have middle or low level school, in Serbia, all school are equal.  

If you study law in Novi Sad, Belgrade, or Nis, it really doesn't matter. All the teacher's are professors, they have the same title, are on the same level.  

There is another method to evaluate students in China. This is one method of evaluating the school.   

In Serbia, people choose the closes city. I live in north of Serbia, so the closes city to me was Novi Sad. Someone who live in the south, would choose Nis, because it is closer.    

When it comes to education and jobs, there is much less pressure in Serbia, compared to China.  

It's not so competitive.  

My company hires only graduates from high level universities.  

985 is a plan for building high level universities.  

Serbia is like a city in China, we have only about 7 000 000 people. Just Shanghai has many times more.   

Suzhou has 13 milion people. Your city has almost twice more people than my country.   

What is happening with Taiwan, my friend told me the war almost broke out, because of the visit of American lady.  

In my opinion there should be a war. Sometimes you need to show your power.  

If there is a war, China will win the war, but there will a lot of negative economic consequences.  

If the war breaks out, the NATO will sanction China.  

The negative economic effect will be temporary.  

China is important country in the world's economy, so other countries depend on China too.  

Covid-19 has shown that China has a power to control everything, and can easily recover.
