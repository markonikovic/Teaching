I have been working for 9 hours.

No, I don't.  

Why did you have to work so much today?  
We need to a lot of things to report work that has been done during the week and the plan for the next week.  

Don't assume people will understand what you are saying.  

How would you evaluate your reading skills?  
My readings skills are not good.  

Why do you evaluate them as such?  
Sometimes I can understand the meaning of articles quickly.  

Why does that happen?  
You don't understand the words in the article or you are easily distracted.  

I can't indetify the main idea of an article.  

Then it means that what are you are reading is not written very well.  

What do you mean by article?  

What do you read?  
I read historical novels.  

How many books do you read?  
Last year I read three books.  

What do you think, is this enough?  
I think it's little.  

Why don't you read more?  
I don't have time for reading.  

What do you study?  
I study government management.  

What is management?  


I read a lot of books three years ago.  

You stopped studying. I am working.   

Do you think if a person starts to work, he or she can stop studying?  
No, I don't.  

Three years ago I have read a lot of books.  

Ideas are too complex.  

How to get reading skills?  

How about the reading environment?  

What kind of environment would be ideal for reading?  
A library is good for reading.  

It's a little troublesome if you need to go to library every time you want to read.  

I think everyone should have a reading place at home.  

Do you read at home?  
Yes, I do. I always read books when I lie down.  

I think it's better to sit and read. If we are comfortable when reading, I think most people will become sleepy.  

How about light?  
The light shouldn't be very bright.  

It would be best to natural light, so if you have a reading chair it would be best if you can position it next to the window.  

Othewise you can use a lamp.  

How about the time?  
The best time is in the evening.  

How else do we study?  
We can study by watching documentaries, actually doing things, experiencing, listening...  

Which of these methods do you use the most?  
I used reading the most when I was a student, but in work experience matters the most.  

Working and studying to maximize learning?  
When we read, we learn theory, the main goal is to use that theory in real life.  

Some people say that theory is useless if you can't put it in practice.  

What are you going to do after the class?
