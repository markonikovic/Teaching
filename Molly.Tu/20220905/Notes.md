English is very strict when it comes to time. When you refer to something that happened, before this moment, you have to use past tense.

I could book lesson twice a week but recently I can books classes once a week.

Pareto principle  
20% of people own 80% percent of land.  
20% of people owned 80% of wealth in the world.

I need to pay attention to my grammar.  

I am hard-working girl.  

I want to improve in every aspect.
