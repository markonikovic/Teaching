How are you doing today?  
I am doing very good.  

What did you do before this class?  
I just got off work.

I woke up today very early, I just my regularly morning routine. I showered, and brushed my teeth. Today it was rainy in the morning, so I couldn't do yoga outside. The weather is getting better, it's still cloudy, but it's not raining anymore...    

My worked has changed a little bit since my boss has left the company.  

Labour law - Every worker must have daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly breaks.  

How is the weather in your city?  
It's over 38 degrees Celsius.  

When we go outside, we sweat a lot.  

**I expect more elaborate answers from you.**
