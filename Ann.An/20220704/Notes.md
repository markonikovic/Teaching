Why did you choose this topic?  
Because when I was young I admired my classmates who studied abroad.  

Why did you admire them?  
I think they had less pressure.  

If they studied less, it means that they didn't get enough knowledge.

There is too much competition in China.  

How do Chinese employers evaluate applicants who graduated from foreign universities?

They get better treatment.  
Some Chinese companies preffer to give offers to people who study abroad.
