How are you doing today?  
I am doing great.  

I had a bad experience yesterday.  
It was a small forum and I presented my paper.    

I have worked hard on this paper for a year.  
Although I new that people would give me a lot of comments and suggestion, I expected it. The result was not good. My colleagues thougth that my paper is not well written. Some of them thought it was meaningless.   

There was something wrong with the logic of my paper.  

To express yourself precisely it's very hard.  

What are your plans for today?  
I will go to university and revise another paper. The deadline for this paper is on 28th of this month.  
It's kind of urgent.
