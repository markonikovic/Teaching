It seems you had another busy day.  

I did a demo.  

What kind of demonstration?  
I did a demostration of our scanner.  

What do you scan?  
We use to scan aluminum section profile.  

What makes aluminum section OK?  

How you gotten acclimated?  
I want to visit a company in Russia.  

Is it hard to go to Russia, since there is a war?  
McDonalds closed all the restaurants in Russia.  

China doesn't sanction Russia.  

They declared that they will keep the temperaure in apartments at 17 degrees Celsius.  

But I heard that Germany imports the majority of it's electricity.  

German cities don't want nuclear power plants to be built.  

I heard a story that they are building public places where people will be able to gather during winter to heat up.  

We are friendly with Russians, we are brother's nation.  

Standard of life in Serbia is low.  

I spent about 1000 EUR on wood for heating this year.  
1000 EUR = 7000 RMB  

Average salary in Serbia is about 500 EUR.  

We have forests that are designed and trees are being selected.  

They select all threes from the forests and cut them, and in their place they plant new trees.  

There are people who do it illegally.  

The inspectors check the wood, there needs to be a mark on the wood, and person who transports need to have a certificate for the wood that they transport.  
But it can go to negative 20 degrees Celsius.  

People in Serbia are in difficult situation, especially poor people.  
I think many people will spend very cold winter.  

The price changes, it's subject to changes.  
The price has increased 6% this year.  

Standrad of life in Germany is much higher, people make much more money in Germany.  
The average salary in Germany is 4 times higher.  

I heard that American's are turning gas into liquid(condensed gas) and they send it by ships to Europe, and this gas is much more expensive than Russian gas.  

One of my students sell granite. He said that the price of shipping has dramatically increased.  

It seems to me that we are bubble.  

Bubble means that prices are blown away, they just unrealisticly high.  

The price has almost doubled this year.
