I am doing good.  

I am pregnant.  
I haven't had a class in Likeshuo for three months.  

Why doesn't pregnancy prevents from learning English?  
I don't feel comfortable.  

You got pregnant three months ago?  
The first period is difficult.  

I was sick and had a headache.  

I don't think this applies of everybody.  

Wife of my cousin, is in her 8th month of pregnancy and she still works in a factory.  

My friend is pregnant and she still keeps working.  

Why are you not good?  
This month I don't feel happy, something has happened.  

My older brother is in hospital.  
He was running and did some exercises on the square and suddenly he collapsed. His had muscle cramp.  

He probably had a stroke, cramping of the muscles was probably just a side-effect.  

Luckly one man was passing by and saw my brother.  
She didn't know where he is.  

He will recover later.  

My brother can't speak anything now.  

Can he walk normally?  
No, he cannot.  

One side of his body is paralyzed.  

The same thing happened to my grandmother.  
She had a high blood prussure, she didn't take her medicine. One day she was working, and she just fell. She had a stroke. She was able to speak, she regained this ability, but her right side of the body was paralyzed, she coudn't control her part arm and right leg. She was about sixty when this happened.  

This happend twenty years ago.  

It was impossible for her to recover for her completely.  
Her brain didn't have enough oxygen for extended period of time, so it was damaged.  

Brain cannot be healed, brain cells cannot created again. All brain cells that we lose, we can't get them back.  

My grandfather took care of her.  

You can't force grown ups to do things they don't want.  

She though that she doesn't need it.  

About 90% of people who go see a doctor don't really follow doctors advice.  

If you mom was feeling good, and doctor told her to take the medicine, would she take it?  

The reason that happened to him is his lifestyle.  
He needs to change his habbits.  

It also depeneds on genetics, so you said your mother has a high blood pressure, so he probably inherited this weakness from your mother.  

No one can save you if you don't take care of yourself.  

If a bad doesn't happen to you, that doesn't mean what you are doing is good.  

Maybe you can steal money, and never get caught. Even if you are a successful thief you are not a good person.  

It's not responsible.  

If you are single, and something happens to you, then you parents or your friends need to take care of you.  

Alcohol alters the conscious mind.  

I drink alcohol socially, so when I am with friends, at parties.  

I drink once a month.  

I have carefully selected my friends, and I never push them to do things that are bad for them, and vice-versa.  

I always decide how much to drink based on how I feel, not based on the pressure from other people.  

Alcohol is adictive.  

You can sing, execrcise, do your hobbies.  

He didn't realize that he needs to protect himself.  

Recently I go my motorbike license. Motorbike is a dangerous tool. You can make decisions that will affect your safety a lot.  

If it's late at night, maybe it's weekend and there drunk and drugged drivers, so even if you ride well, you can die, because other participants in traffic are not responsible.  

If you know this, why would you go and ride motorbike at that time?  
I never ride motorbike at night.  

I wear a special jacket, pants, gloves, and of course a helmet.  
I attend training of safe riding, and I stricktly follow rules of traffic.(speed limit)  

Even if someone makes a mistake, I can slow down, use the techniques of safe breaking, and my protective gear, can prevent injury. So maybe I will be bumped after the crash but I will be OK.  

motorbike - ride  

These days people often see people who fall down, but they don't help.  
I a lot people are trying to cheat. They pretend that they unwell and they when you try to help them, they ask you for money.
