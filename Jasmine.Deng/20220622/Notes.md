## Discussion
What did you do before the class?  
I did a lot of things, I visited a client and they couldn't accept the product.  

This happened when we class last time too.  

Factory needs this product very urgently.  

Who makes the products? Can you talk with the people from the factory?   

Do you anyone to talk to?  

Your customer needs your products so they will buy it.  

Do you like being a salesperson?  

Why they don't offer training, since sales are important?  
It's how company get money in the end.  

I always buy clothes online.  
It's very convients, we can choose from a lot of different styles.  

You can't try the clothes. How do you deal with that?  

Sometimes when ordering online the product that arrives doesn't really match the picture.  

real store

If you shop online you can get a discount, or a better deal.  

Do you feel that shopping online makes you spend more money?  

We use our time to earn money.  

In western countreis we like to say:"Time is money."  

On what do you spend the most of your money?  
I spend most of my money on morgage.  

You bought an apartment?  
How many years of morgage have you left?  
I have 12 years left.  

mort(death)-gage(commitment, responsibility)  

In my country some people who buy apartment take 30 years long morgages, so if you take this loan when you are 30 or 35, it's almost until you die.  

I think in western countries people move a lot because they change jobs a lot. If you buy an apartment in a city, then you are stuck, it's very hard to move.   

It doesn't have to be. It doesn't mean that the house will increase in value, it can decrease.  

We had the situation in the USA, in 2006 or 2008. There was economic crisis.

It was caused by the low interest rate on housing loans.  

A lot of Americans bought houses and cars that they couldn't afford.  

Banks started taking the houses from people, because they couldn't afford to pay alone back.  

It was a problem for the banks too.   

Because no one had money, banks couldn't sell the houses they took. The money was trapped.  

At that time interest rate for a loan was 1%.  

Even because of the Covid restriction in Shanghai, I heard that the price of the apartments fell a little bit. 

I like to have some cash, and I invest in American stock market.  

Every investing, every business is risky.
