I reviewed some passages before this class.

I have to answer five questions during the interview.  

I practiced these questions.  

What kind of interview are you going to have?  
It's a job interview.  

For what kind of job are you applying?  
I am applying for a job in a government.  

The interview was planned to take place in March, but because of the Covid-19 it was changed for this month.

It's better to work for the government, it's a more stable job.

What do you think about borrowing money?  
It isn't a good experience. It's offen akward and embarassing.   

There is a negative stigma around borrowed money.  

I don't think that borrowing money is always bad.  

Borrowing money from friends and relatives is not good. It can ruin your relationship with them.  

If you borrow money to buy a liability(car), I would say it's bad.  
But if you borrow money to buy an asset, I would say that this debt is good.  

You can use debt as a leverage when you invest.  

Do you have any debt?  
Yes, I do. I bought my house six years ago, and I borrowed a lot from the bank.  

There is a big difference between a house and an apartment.  

I bought an apartment.  

Apartments are very expensive in China but houses are even more expensive.  

I had a credit card but I didn't use it.  

You still need to connect WeChatPay and AliPay with your card or bank account.  

Since it's so easy to spend money, do you think this makes people overspend?  

People often buy things they don't need.  

What was this conversation about?  
I woman wants to buy a house and she wants to get a loan from the bank, so she went to the bank and the banker talked with her. He asked about her bank statement. Then after checked her credit score, he said that she could get a loan worth $300 000 and the woman was very pleased with the result. The banker told the woman that they will call her when the loan is ready, within three working days.   

Credit history is used to calculate the risk of borrowing money.  

You have to make 30% downpayment before getting the loan. For a lot of people even getting these 30% of money is quite hard.  

What is the interest rate in China?  
It's about 5%.  

I bought my house on discounted interest rate.  

Basically low interest rate is good against inflation.  

You are paying your house with the money that is worth less.  

Normal level of inflation in the world is about 2% but these days it's much higher.  

If inflation is 5% and the interest rate of a loan is 2%, you are actually earning 3% with the loan.
