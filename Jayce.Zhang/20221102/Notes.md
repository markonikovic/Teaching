## Grammar
### Past Simple
Positive statements you need to conjugate the verb.  
I worked.  

When you make negative statements, you don't conjugate the main verb but the auxiliary verb.

Same for the questions, you conjugate the auxiliary verb?  
Do you like apples?  
Did you like apples?(do - did)  

### Questions
did - past simple  
do - present simple  

### Negative Statements
Negative statements are made based on their tense.  
Past Simple - didn't - when you want to say that something didn't happen in the past.   
Preset Simple - don't/doesn't  
Present Perfect - haven't/hasn't  

### To Be
WHen you want to say that something exists or it is true, you must use the verb "to be", not "have" like in Chinese.
