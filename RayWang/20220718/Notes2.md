What do you think about Chinese foreign trade?  

They told me that under new regulations only 50% of students in China will be able to go to high school. From these 50% only 50% will be able to study at the university.  

Aren't the universities under the control of Chinese government?  
Is there ministry of education?  

University accept 800 students.  

You have your high school scores  and you need to do an entrance exam for that university.  

Wheather you graduate from the Law University of Novi Sad, Belgrade, or Nis, it doesn't matter. You are a lawyer.  


I heard that Chinese president declared reduction of import from other countries, especially when it comes space and high technology.  

Poeple lack creative thoughts.
