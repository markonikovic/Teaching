## Grammar
### Time
Time is expressed with verbs. We can use adverbs of time and frequency to express but they have to be in relationship with the tense.  

I will drink coffee yesterday.(wrong, the tense and adverb don't match)  
I will drink coffee tomorrow.(correct)  

### Gerund
Gerund is a form of a verb that acts like a noun.  
Gerund is made by adding -ing suffix to the verb.  
This form is used when naming an activity or state.  

eat(verb) - action  
eating(gerund) - name of the activity.  

I like dancing.(name of an activity that I like)  

hike(verb)  
hiking(gerund)  

**You can also use infinitive to name activities**  
Infinitive form: to + verb  

I like to drink coffee.(infinitive)  
I like drinking coffee.(gerund)  

### Adjectives
Adjectives can be divided into two groups based on their "strenght": weak and strong adjectives.  

| weak | strong
| --- | ---
| big | huge
| small | tiny
| pretty | gorgeous
| good | perfect

This is very important to keep in mind when using adverbs to modify adjectives. You need to use strong adverbs with strong adjectives.  

very excellent(wrong) - weak adverb and strong adjective  
very good(correct) - weak and weak  
extremely gorgeous - strong and strong
