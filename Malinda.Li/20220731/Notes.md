# Age Is The New Battleground
## Discussion
I didn't need to work today.  

How did you spend your Sunday?  
I woke up very late in the morning. I ordered a lunch from the Internet. I ordered a lunch from a restaurant named Meituan.   

I misunderstood you.  

What are your plans for the rest of the day(future)?  
I plan to read an English article and study astrology.

What factors influence the outcome of a job interview?  
For me one of the most important factors are English, working experience, educational background, logical thinking, and soft skills.  

Nothing else influences the outcome of a job interview.  

Are you telling me that your work experience doesn't matter, your educational background doesn't matter? When applying for a job?  

Good companies in China hire only students from best universities.  

Is that a reasonable assumption?  
It's not always true.  

I have a student, she works in a big investment firm in Beijing. She is in charge of hiring process, and she throws away all CVs, she doesn't even read them, all the CVs are not from Beijing university.

Do you prefer a stable job over a temporary job?  
I prefer to have a stable job because I don't have any experience with temporary jobs.  

I don't have any experience with temporary jobs, so I have no capabilities to do them.  

During our work, we have many problem that we need to figure out. Before we figure them out, we need to break them down and to create requirement and allocate resources to solving these problems. We can follow this plan to solve them. Many people are confused when breaking down cases.  

I can figure our or solve any problem. I am a problem solver.
