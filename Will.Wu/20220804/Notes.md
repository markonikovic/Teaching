Do you save money in the bank?  
It's a good idea to save money in the bank.  
I think that makes keeping money in the bank very dangerous.  

High inflation deteriorates the value of money, so why would you want to deposit your money for a long-term, where it will lose it's value every year.  

One of the best ways to protect yourself from inflation is investing in gold and silver.  

What interest rate do you get for saving money in China?  
We get about 2% per year.  

That is much lower than inflation, so by saving money in the bank, you are losing it.
