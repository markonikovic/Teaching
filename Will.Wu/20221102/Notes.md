Especially if you count programming languages.

I have a habit after work, I usually go to the gym. This experience can help me release bad emotion.  

Exercising is a great way to get rid of bad emotions.  

What physical effects can stress have on your body?  

Becoming bad tempered because of stress, is mental change, not physical.  

e.g. Physical change could be sweating, shaking hards, headache, redness in face, swelling, etc.  

There aren't any physical changes when it comes to me, I only become bad tempered.  

This is a useful way, when it comes to reducing stress.

You can fight with the wolf, you can run away, or just freeze.
