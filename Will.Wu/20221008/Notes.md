How did you spend this holiday?  
There are some Covid-19 cases in my city. I stayed in the city. I went to a park.

When is China going to be completely open?  
It will maybe happen next year.  

I can visit Thailand next year.  

I heard that in this month, you will have presidential elections.  
Is that true?   
One student told me on 16th October.  

Are you going to vote?  
No, I am not.  

Why not?  
Only members of party can vote.  

You can't choose.  

Elections work diffently in Europe and the USA. We all vote for candidates.  
In the USA you have two parties: liberals(democrats) and conservatives(republicans).  

In my country, in Serbia, there is not limit. We can 100 parties.  

I am not happy with our system in Serbia, because vote of a person who doesn't know anything, is same as a vote of a smart person.  

Since everyone has a vote a person who knows nothing about politics, can choose. I don't think this is good.  

I think smart and knowledgeable people should make decisions.  

Do you know where democracy came from?  
It came from ancient Greece.  

Ancient Greece is the oldest European civilization.

Would you like to be an entrepreneur?  
It's a difficult job.  

Why is so difficult about being an entrepreneur?  
You need to have enough money, professional knowledge, and accept the adventure(risk taker).  

Why people choose to be entrepreneurs if it's so difficult?  
If you are successful you will get a lot of respect and money.  

It's raining cats and dogs. (It rains heavily) 

Does China encourage entrepreneurs?  
Government policies usually change, so it's hard to be an entrepreneur.  

Jack Ma emigrated to a European country like Switzerland, I think.
