# The Uninvited Visitor
## Discussion
Have you tried experimenting with different patterns of sleep?  
Some famous people like Nikola Tesla(famous physicist, responsible for alternating current).  

There are two kinds of current: direct and alternating.  

Nikola Tesla supposedly spelt only four hours a day.  
He also lived to be 82 years old.  

Are we sleeping too much?  
I don't believe he only slept that little.  

Maybe it's just a habbit. Like you a habbit of taking naps, and they work for you, I don't have this habbit so it doesn't work for me. 

Maybe sleeping 4 hours a day is a habbit that we can develop?  

Your energy levels depend on your sleep, diet, activities, general health, environment, etc.    

Leonardo Da Vinci  

There are few things that influece our sleep patterns: light, eating food, activity...
