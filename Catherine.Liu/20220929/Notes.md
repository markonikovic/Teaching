This is not true, not always. It just try under certain air pressure.  

As you go higher, atmospheric pressure is lower.   

We can't reduce pressure so much naturally but in a laboratory, scientist can achieve "three points of water". It's the state in which pressure is so low that water boils, melts, a freezes at the same time.
