# Changing Career
## Discussion
We took part in an activity.  

We learned to make a cake.  

The activity was held by a eye hospital.  

This is a little bit strange activity to be held by an eye hospital.  

My son is getting short-sighted. I always take him on medical exams in this hospital.  

Many kinds are getting short-sighted, they all wear speacial glasses.  

This technology was inveted over ten years ago.  

My son's eyesight is worsening.  

Why this happens?  
There is too much homework that students need to do. They don't spend enough time outside. This might be an effect of artificial lights.   

Although doctor's recommned two hours of ourdoor activity, students just don't have time for it.  

Does the fact that they study so much, has an effect on mental health?  
Yes, it does.  

Our government tried to change the situation, the government asked not to assign homework after school.  

Teachers get rank and salary based on the student's perfomance, so they force the students to do a lot of homework and too study extensively.  


There are state-owned school(public schools) and private schools.  

Students have more pressure in a private school.  

Education and employment in China are too competitive.  

Half of the students can't go to a high school.  
They go to a vocational school.  

Parents want their children to have better jobs, and higher education.  

I heard that there is a shortage of blue-collar workers in China.  
Even though, they can make a decent amount of money, people don't want to do this job, they feel embarassed.  

There is no shame in doing honest work, whether it's with your hands or with your head.  

Is traditional culture preventing people from being happy?  

After China became open, the differences are becoming bigger and bigger.  

It's a Chinese tradition that a future husband needs to have a house, a car, and all material things necessary for life.  

Most of the couples can work hard and afford to buy a home by themselves.   
In my country it's normal not to own anything before the marriage.  

Have you ever thought about changing your career?  
I have changed my career three times.  

I am an algorithm engineer. When I graduated from college my first job was hardware engineer. I worked in my first company for five years and change the into a embedded software engineer, and FPGA engineer. Then I changed a company and then I became an algorithm engineer.      

Was it difficult to change career so many times?  
These jobs are related.  

Have you ever thought about doing something else?  
I tried to own my business, I found some colleagues but we felt it's easy to design a product, but it's hard to produce and sell it.   

How do you feel about your job?  
I like my job. There are some things that I don't like.  

I don't like my department manager.  
Why?  
We can't trust him because he took part of our bonuses.  
The company gave us a bonus, but he gave bonus to us, but he cut the part of the bonus for himself.  

This bonus wasn't meant for him.  

How wasn't he fired?  
We didn't know about it. We just saw that the bonus was reduced.  

Did you talk with HR about it?  
Yes, we did.  
We talked about this with HR.  

What did they say?  
The company and the boss thought that this is illegal but our manager wasn't fired.  
The company though that at that time it was important for our department to be stable. 

Did they punish him somehow?  
He lost the opportunity to get a promotion, or a higher salary.  

If he is a manager, he probably get's paid more than you.  
Why is he so greedy?
