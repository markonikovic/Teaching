What is more important health or taste?  Dear Edward,

Thank you so much for booking my class, you have shown great speaking and listening skills. Today we had a great lesson review. You learned new vocabulary, practiced reading, and reviewed the important grammar points.

Make sure you review the lesson notes, as they contain the important information that will lead to your improvement. You should be able to download the lesson notes from the homework section of our class. If, for some reason, you can't find them, please let your SA know.

If you managed to do your homework please send it to me on my homepage. Don't do it on the lesson's webpage because I don't get notified if you do so. I check my homepage every day and will do my best to check and send you corrections and feedback.

Keep up with good work, I am looking forward to meeting you in the future.  

Best regards,
Marko.

Don't forget to evaluate the class.
