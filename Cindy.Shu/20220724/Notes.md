## Grammar
### Gerund and infinitive form
They make a verb act as a noun.  
to drink or drinking(is the name of the action - so it acts as a noun.)  

### Nouns
Nouns are words that give names.  
pen  
teacher  
house   
chair  
China  

### Problem of two main verbs
You can never have two main verbs in once sentence.  

I like drink tea.(wrong - there are two main verbs: drink and like)

We need to change the second verb.  

We can use infinitive form(to + verb):  
I like to drink tea.(correct)  

We can use gerund form(verb + ing):  
I like drinking tea.(correct)  

**Don't do both:**  
I like to drinking tea.(wrong)  

### Words that indicate plurality
After words like "many, some, a lot of, one of, few..." you need to use plural form of countable noun.  

many teacher(incorrect)  
many teachers(correct)  

some exercise(wrong)   
some exercises(correct)  

### Past
We use verbs to express what subject does, but also to tell the time.  

I eat  
I ate  

These two sentences describe the same action, but the time is different. English language is really precise about the time.  
Don't forget the second component of a verb which is time.
