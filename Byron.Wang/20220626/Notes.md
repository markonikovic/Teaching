A car mechanic fixes cars that are broken.  

How often do you go to a car mechanic?  
Unfortunately I don't own a car for now.

In my city public transportation is very developed and well constructed.  

What kind of public transportation do you have?

How do you get to different cities and countries?  
I normally take a high speed train and an airplane to travel long distances.  

I take a high speed train more frequently.  

Why do you prefer high speed train over an airplane?  
An airline ticket is more expensive than train ticket.  

I use high speed train for destinations that are not too far.  
High speed train is fast enough I think to get to most cities in China.  

How would you describe a job of a car mechanic?  
It's difficult and challenging. It requires good training, a lot of exeperience.  

How about tools?  
This job require a lot of different tools and equipment.  

These days it becomes more difficult, because new cars have complicated electric parts, so car mechanics need to keep educating themselves.  

In the past cars had a lot of mechanical parts, but these days these parts are electric.  

What do you think about the future of this job?  
This job is going be more demanded in the future.  

Why makes you think so?  
Because cars are becoming more common and complicated.  

I think that car mechanics are not going to repair car parts in the future, they just going to take out the broken part and put in the new one.  

Since you can't repair anything, you have to buy new parts all the time.
