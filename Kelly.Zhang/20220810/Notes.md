## Discussion
How are you doing today?  
I am good.  

What did you do before this class?  
I ate my dinner.  

Are you trying to speak as least as possible?  
Yeah.  

Why is that your goal?  

If I don't hear something I don't say yes.  
I woke up at 7 am and I brushed my teeth, I washed my hands and face.  I went to the hospital. I have been sick recently. I have hypertension.  

Last week, I took the physical examination.  
The doctor advised me to go to the hospital, to visit cardiologist.  

I went to see cardiologist in the morning.  

The doctor said that my situation is not very bad. I don't have to take a medicine.  

I woke up so early, the day has been long. I took a nap because I woke up very early.  

Why did you miss Monday's class?  
I was sick. I couldn't take part in that lesson.   

When I opened the class I couldn't cancel it.  

What is emotional eating?  
In my opinion, emotional eating, is eating when you feel stressed, unhappy, or just bored.  

Do you ever eat emotionally?  
I usually eat emotionally.  

Why?  
I can't realise it, I eat a lot when watching TV series.  

Of course you do, you just said, when you watch TV you eat too much.  

Why don't you make an eating plan, and stick to that plan.  

No snacks, is a really useful way.  
If you snack things like nuts, or fruit, you will realize that you can't really eat too much for these snacks.  

How many apples can you eat?  
I don't like apples, I like peaches.  

I bet you can't eat too many peaches.  

Have you ever felt real hunger? 
I lost my lunchtime.  

For how long have you fasted?  
I have fasted for seven days. 

That is not fasting.   

Even if you drink it, it still food, it still containts nutrients and calories.  

I just drank celery juice.  

You probably knew that this diet is not sustainable, why did you even try it?  
I wanted to lose weight quickly.  

I only lost 3 grams.  

When you are choosing a diet, try to be too hard on yourself at first, and choose something that is sustainable.  

You want to lose fats, so in first two weeks you can just stop eating sweets.  
Next week you stop eating breakfast.  

Even if that diet worked, you would probably return all the kilograms you lost quickly as soon as you would return to your previous diet.  

How to combat emotional eating?  
The best method to combat emotional eating is to another thing like talking to a friend, exercise, read a book, do hobbies, etc.
