## Family vs School Education
I think family education is more important. Family is the first school.
Good family education is a starting point.
Quality of family education directly affects child's life.  

Education in school and at home are not something that you can compare, they are equaly important. From home child needs to learn basic values. Based on the values, child's behavior is molded. In school children needs to learn academic knowledge.  

There is a large number of experiments.  

What kind of experiments?  

I don't think that parents should do or help children with homework. That is not the responsibility of parents.  

Why is dual responsibility always avoided in business? Why should we create this kind of responsibility in education?  

There are many cases...  
Shouldn't classes be designed in such way that average student can't complete the homework and all the assignments.  

Isn't it irresponsible to assign the responsiility to parents that they objectively cannot overcome.  

Parents can motivate children.  

Teachers assign so much homework and schoolwork.  

Ratings of school.  
In educational system diffent school are evaluated differently, some of them highly, some of them not so highly.  

If live in a country with one government and if government contrls and owns all the schools, well they should be equal.  

There shouldn't be a bad or better school.  

They assign too much homework, so that their rating goes up, and rating of the school. They don't assign schoolwork to students because of the importance of knowledge, they are motivated by the profit and rank.  

Competition is a natural phenomenon, you don't need to create it artificially.  

## IQ or EQ
EQ is more important, people can adapt better to society.  

## Social Media - Isolation or Connection?
Social media makes us connected.  
Communicating became so convenient.  

Hormones of happiness(seratonin). This is the hormone that activates when we are with friends, and when we are encouraged and recognized by people.  

Fake profiles, is just one of the problems of social media.  
Postinig fake or filtered photos can hurt the confidence of people don't.  
Rate of suicide in the USA has increased drastically especially within the population of young girls.  

There are so many excellent people on the world.  

## Grammar
### To Be
In Chinese you use verb "have" in situations like:  
There have many people in China.(wrong)  

To express that something exists or it's true make sure you use verb "to be"  
There are many people in China.
